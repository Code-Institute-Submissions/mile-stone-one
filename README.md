# Mile Stone Project One. 
## By Rusne Supronaite.
## UX
     
In this project I created a a webiste of 5 pages for the band The Monkees. 
The idea to include the band memebers and a logo in the header came up because. Once I had the theme the header
looked very plain and also didnt really give any information to the user about what webpage they were on therefore
it was more likely they would not remember the webpage and therefore not visit again.

## Features
    
My first page only containes a main image of the band together as well as a contact us form. 
This lets the user know that they have entered the bands website.

 The header i have also kept images of each of the band memebers including their logo.
this is a theme that i have kept throughout the the website.
The lets the user know excatly what website they are on.

I orginally designed to be dark colours such shades or grey and white, however once i started putting in images 
of the band and album work, this theme no longer blended well togeather. 
At that point I changed the colour scheme to blue and red.
I tried a few different shades or reds and blues. but the reason i stuck with this one is because the logo in the 
header is has a blue background and i notices that in alot of their artwork the title was red. 
i used the red for the header and footer because i felt the red on the main body would be too distracting and
would clash with all the text and images. 

## Technogolgies used

 1. For my font I used Google fonts to find the one that best suited the theme. I originally pick out a very plain and 
skinny text. However after showing family memebers and friends for critizism they all mentioned the font was 
"boring" and didnt quite fit into the scheme and became to distracting as it was standing out 
so much. So decdied to use Do Hyeon, sans- because i felt it suited the band and the theme alot nicer. 
After showing people thw website witht the new font applied I recieved postitive feedback.

 2. For my button on shop.html I used bootstrap, they had a large choice of diffierent button I could used. 
I specifially chose this style because I  though white stood out too much and a blue blended in with the
backgrond of it. The filled in red button also was too distracting to look at and drew you away from the 
products. however the outlined red sat well the the background and also went along nicely with the red header and 
footer. 

 3. I also used font awesome to get my icons on the header and footer. I didnt orginally plan on using font awesome or
the icons however the header looked plain and boring to look at. So I decided to use appropriate icons which I 
feel gives the user an idea of what is on each webpage before they go to it. 

 4. My project was finally deployed using GitHub.

## Testing
  
 The project was tested through chrome on different devices such as laptops, desktops and iPads. I also used the 
developer tools however when testing in on different screen sizes I noticed that while chrome would tell me that
the website doesnt look as I wanted it to look on say an iPad Pro, once I tested in on an actualy iPad pro the 
website looked excalty how I wanted it to.

Along the way I did encounter a few errors such after working on the project and coming back to it the next day 
all the images stopped showing up, even though they were all there the previous day. To fix this issue I
had to reupload the images and this fixed the issue. 
Some of my code was indeed based on other code, from one of my mimi projects. specifially I sampled the code for 
the footer, I only needed the base layout of it.
